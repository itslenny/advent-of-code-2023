# Advent of code 2023

This is my code from advent of code. Everything is written in plain JavaScript and the code is mostly quick, hacky, and da-da-dirty-dirty. Enjoy!

The first commit in this repo has no answers. Feel free to fork as a starter project if you're doing advent of code. I'll be adding answers as I do them, but with at least a day delay as to not spoil anything for those competing on the leader board.

## Usage

I created a little wrapper so I can run any of the days using `npm start` here are some quick examples:

```bash
# run day 1 task 1 with real input
npm start 1-1

# run day 1 task 1 with TEST input
npm start 1-1 test

# run day 20 task 2 with real input
npm start 20-2

# run day 20 task 2 with test input
npm start 20-2 test
```
